=======================

BitStomp Labs: Bitmapper. This is an old (circa 2010) JavaScript project I built as a demo for a job interview.

From the site's About section:

**What is BitMapper?**

*Nutshell:*

A "bit" of a novelty, BitMapper is a bit-themed web app which allows you to design patterns of varying complexity as a unique form of creativity. Designs can be saved and then dynamically re-created by you and other members using BitMapper's automated renderer. 

*A little background:*

BitMapper was originally conceived while working on a bit-themed idea for the main page of Bitstomp Labs. (For the non-geeks: a bit is the basic element used to store data on a computer. It has two states: 1 or 0. Think of it as "on" or "off.") The idea began as an interactive background consisting of a grid of white squares labeled with zeros. When clicked, a white square would transform into a black square labeled with a one. Clicking again would flip the "bit" back to zero. 

After development began for this simple interactive background, more ideas grew out of the grid approach. It was discovered that the grid could be an entertaining way to create basic pixel art. This realization led to the idea that the squares could be broken down into fourths, allowing for greater creative flexibility (plus it's just fun!). Soon, the "interactive background" concept evolved into a functional project of its own: Project BitMapper. An entertaining novelty, BitMapper also allows users to create and share their creations using a simple and easy-to-use interface.
