                            <strong>Nutshell:</strong>
                            <br /><br />
                            A "bit" of a novelty, BitMapper is a bit-themed web app which allows you to design 
                            patterns of varying complexity as a unique form of creativity. Designs can be saved
                            and then dynamically re-created by you and other members using BitMapper's automated renderer. 
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>A little background:</strong>
                            <br /><br />
                            BitMapper was originally conceived while working on a bit-themed idea for the 
                            main page of Bitstomp Labs. (For the non-geeks: a bit is the basic element used
                            to store data on a computer. It has two states: 1 or 0. Think of it as "on" or "off.")
                            The idea began as an interactive background consisting of a grid of white squares
                            labeled with zeros. When clicked, a white square would transform into a black square
                            labeled with a one. Clicking again would flip the "bit" back to zero. 
                            <br /><br />
                            After development began for this simple interactive background, more ideas grew
                            out of the grid approach. It was discovered that the grid could be an entertaining
                            way to create basic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art" target="new">pixel art</a>.
                            This realization led to the idea that the squares could be broken down into fourths,
                            allowing for greater creative flexibility (plus it's just fun!). Soon, 
                            the "interactive background" concept evolved into a functional project of its own: Project
                            BitMapper. An entertaining novelty, BitMapper also allows users to create and share their
                            creations using a simple and easy-to-use interface.

                    <h3><a href="#">Getting Started</a></h3>

                            <strong>First Steps:</strong>
                            <br /><br />
                            BitMapper is extremely simple and easy to use. To create a design, just click a white "0" bit (square)
                            within the grid to flip it to a black "1" bit. Continue to do so with adjacent bits in order to
                            create a basic design or pattern. 
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Finer Detail:</strong>
                            <br /><br />
                            To add finer detail to your design, you also have the option of "quadifying" a bit into 4 
                            smaller bits. Instead of clicking, just hold down the left mouse button until the bit reaches the
                            state of quadification (in other words, just hold it down until something happens). Those smaller bits 
                            can then be quadified themselves, as well as the next level (you get the picture).
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Saving Your Creation:</strong>
                            <br /><br />
                            Once you have a design you are satisfied with, you have the option to save it to the BitMapper 
                            public gallery. Simply click "Save," provide a name for your masterpiece, and click "Okay." Your
                            design should then become instantly available in the public gallery. 
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Rendering Other Designs:</strong>
                            <br /><br />
                            To automatically render designs from the public gallery, simply click "Render" and choose from the
                            list of saved designs. The BitMapper rendering engine will then begin re-creating the original design. 
                            To increase or decrease render speed, click "Options" and adjust the speed slider to your liking.

                            <br /><br />
                            As stated in the "What is BitMapper?" section, this project was (and still is) a product of 
                            programmatic evolution. As the orignal features were developed, new ideas were conceived and
                            integrated into the project. BitMapper started its life more or less as a novelty of modern
                            JavaScript potential.
                            <br /><br />
                            Some noteworthy facts:
                            <br />
                            <ul>
                                <li>The grid is entirely generated by JavaScript and custom-fitted to available screen size.</li>
                                <li>Although not currently a user option, the grid cell size is designed to be easily scalable
                                by simply changing one determining variable.</li>
                                <li>An array-based code was invented in order to save designs to a database in a concise
                                but easily-readable form. Due to the dynamic nature of the grid, basic multi-dimensional
                                coordinates were simply not practical.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br />
                            <strong>Challenges:</strong>
                            <br /><br />
                            Although BitMapper seems fairly simple, there were some significant challenges behind the
                            fundamental concepts. Undoubtedly, the number one source of difficulty was the JavaScript 
                            rendering engine. Performing step-by-step, time-based transformations was obviously not 
                            part of JavaScript's original purpose, and that weakness was made apparent at several points
                            during this project.
                            <br /><br />
                            The primary focus with performing a render animation was to prevent JavaScript from overloading
                            the browser or causing the page load to time out. This was accomplished by generating a 
                            rendering queue on initialization and chaining JavaScript functions to execute individually and
                            sequentially rather than returning back to a primary controller function or loop.
                            <br /><br />
                            The app was originally plagued by timing issues caused by the nature of JavaScript's workhorse
                            delay function, <em>setTimeout()</em>. This built-in function is provided a time value and a 
                            function to be executed after the delay. However, <em>setTimeout()</em> does not ever return a
                            value to the originating function and basically creates a rogue "process" that executes outside
                            the control of the caller. Although the independence of these function calls were what 
                            allowed the rendering engine to succeed, managing hundreds of <em>setTimeout()</em> calls is like
                            herding cats.
                            <br /><br />
                            Although timing was eventually synchronized to a decent degree, the script execution was still subject
                            to the flaky whims of the user's browser. Such is the plight of client-side development. It was
                            at this point that the "warning" labels were added to the render speed slider to indicate the 
                            probability that the renderer would make "mistakes." Fortunately, a backward-reading error check 
                            was added which now virtually guarantees that each rendering step is completed correctly before
                            proceeding. However, the "warning" labels are still included purely for entertainment purposes.
                            <br /><br />
                            As a small sidenote, it is worth pointing out that this project is still a work in progress. One 
                            of the delayed sub-projects is Internet Explorer compatibility. Some classes and attributes need
                            to be explicitly added to some DOM objects before Internet Explorer will begin to function well.
                            The delay of this sub-project is in no way connected to the developer's alleged disdain of 
                            the browser and Microsofts's smug lack of effort to comply with industry standards and practices.
