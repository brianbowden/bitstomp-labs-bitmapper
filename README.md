Bitstomp Labs: Bitmapper
=======================

<img src="https://i.cloudup.com/VBrIQWC50e-3000x3000.png" border="1" alt="Screenshot">

This is an old (circa 2010) JavaScript project I built as a demo for a job interview. The original server instance is long gone, but I thought I'd throw the code on GitHub for posterity's sake.

From the site's "About" section:


##What is BitMapper?##

###Nutshell###

A "bit" of a novelty, BitMapper is a bit-themed web app which allows you to design patterns of varying complexity as a unique form of creativity. Designs can be saved and then dynamically re-created by you and other members using BitMapper's automated renderer. 

###A little background###

BitMapper was originally conceived while working on a bit-themed idea for the main page of Bitstomp Labs. (For the non-geeks: a bit is the basic element used to store data on a computer. It has two states: 1 or 0. Think of it as "on" or "off.") The idea began as an interactive background consisting of a grid of white squares labeled with zeros. When clicked, a white square would transform into a black square labeled with a one. Clicking again would flip the "bit" back to zero. 

After development began for this simple interactive background, more ideas grew out of the grid approach. It was discovered that the grid could be an entertaining way to create basic pixel art. This realization led to the idea that the squares could be broken down into fourths, allowing for greater creative flexibility (plus it's just fun!). Soon, the "interactive background" concept evolved into a functional project of its own: Project BitMapper. An entertaining novelty, BitMapper also allows users to create and share their creations using a simple and easy-to-use interface.


##Getting Started##

###First Steps###

BitMapper is extremely simple and easy to use. To create a design, just click a white "0" bit (square) within the grid to flip it to a black "1" bit. Continue to do so with adjacent bits in order to create a basic design or pattern. 

###Finer Detail###

To add finer detail to your design, you also have the option of "quadifying" a bit into 4 smaller bits. Instead of clicking, just hold down the left mouse button until the bit reaches the state of quadification (in other words, just hold it down until something happens). Those smaller bits can then be quadified themselves, as well as the next level (you get the picture). 

###Saving Your Creation###

Once you have a design you are satisfied with, you have the option to save it to the BitMapper public gallery. Simply click "Save," provide a name for your masterpiece, and click "Okay." Your design should then become instantly available in the public gallery. 

###Rendering Other Designs###

To automatically render designs from the public gallery, simply click "Render" and choose from the list of saved designs. The BitMapper rendering engine will then begin re-creating the original design. To increase or decrease render speed, click "Options" and adjust the speed slider to your liking.


##Technical Overview##

###Central Concepts###

As stated in the "What is BitMapper?" section, this project was (and still is) a product of programmatic evolution. As the orignal features were developed, new ideas were conceived and integrated into the project. BitMapper started its life more or less as a novelty of modern JavaScript potential. 

###Some noteworthy facts###

The grid is entirely generated by JavaScript and custom-fitted to available screen size.
Although not currently a user option, the grid cell size is designed to be easily scalable by simply changing one determining variable.
An array-based code was invented in order to save designs to a database in a concise but easily-readable form. Due to the dynamic nature of the grid, basic multi-dimensional coordinates were simply not practical.

###Challenges###

Although BitMapper seems fairly simple, there were some significant challenges behind the fundamental concepts. Undoubtedly, the number one source of difficulty was the JavaScript rendering engine. Performing step-by-step, time-based transformations was obviously not part of JavaScript's original purpose, and that weakness was made apparent at several points during this project. 

The primary focus with performing a render animation was to prevent JavaScript from overloading the browser or causing the page load to time out. This was accomplished by generating a rendering queue on initialization and chaining JavaScript functions to execute individually and sequentially rather than returning back to a primary controller function or loop. 

The app was originally plagued by timing issues caused by the nature of JavaScript's workhorse delay function, setTimeout(). This built-in function is provided a time value and a function to be executed after the delay. However, setTimeout() does not ever return a value to the originating function and basically creates a rogue "process" that executes outside the control of the caller. Although the independence of these function calls were what allowed the rendering engine to succeed, managing hundreds of setTimeout() calls is like herding cats. 

Although timing was eventually synchronized to a decent degree, the script execution was still subject to the flaky whims of the user's browser. Such is the plight of client-side development. It was at this point that the "warning" labels were added to the render speed slider to indicate the probability that the renderer would make "mistakes." Fortunately, a backward-reading error check was added which now virtually guarantees that each rendering step is completed correctly before proceeding. However, the "warning" labels are still included purely for entertainment purposes. 

As a small sidenote, it is worth pointing out that this project is still a work in progress [2014: No, it isn't]. One of the delayed sub-projects is Internet Explorer compatibility. Some classes and attributes need to be explicitly added to some DOM objects before Internet Explorer will begin to function well. The delay of this sub-project is in no way connected to the developer's alleged disdain of the browser and Microsofts's smug lack of effort to comply with industry standards and practices.
